# VoiceAssistant
 This is a Windows Voice Assistant coded in Python!
 To experiment on VoiceAssistant on your PC, clone this repository and run the speech_text.py file.
 Please hit me up with suggestions/bugs/errors or whatever it is you wanna tell me at Cweeper#9636

#How To Use

 The trigger as of now is 'please' followed by whatever you want the assistant to do. The Assistant can perform a set of functions which Include:
 
 - Opening an exe file: 'please open {filename}'
 - Tell the time: 'please tell the time'
 - Say a joke: 'please tell a joke'
 - sleep for a specified period: 'please sleep {duration} seconds/minutes/hours'
 
 
 This is just a Demo model and thus, there are very few commands in existence (its only been 2 days) as of now. You can definitely look forward to more!
